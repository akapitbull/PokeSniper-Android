## IMPORTANT
To avoid softban, please check first in Offiical App and catch a pokemon. If pokemon's result is flee, then your account is softban.

**Home Coordinates**

Set this value to the last coordinates when you play, there's 3 categories to set this coordinates:

1. Official App
    - When you're using the Official App, please use that last coordinates used in Official app.
2. Bot
    - This coordinates a bit difficult, because bot is always moving its position/coordinates. Sometimes after you were botting then using this app, you'll get softban.
3. Sniper
    - When you use sniper program (Android or PC), use the value from that program and don't change it.

With these 3 categories, we have tested it and the result we didn't get any softban so far.

*It is recommended to pretend you are flying on an airplane.  Jump to different locations by logging off and back on to the app based upon how long a typical commercial flight would take.*

*Changing your Device_ID to avoid permaban*
If Niantic decides to issue permanent bans. They will be either by IP or Device_ID. Currently most of the botting apps make the users have the same Device_ID. It would be wise to change it prior to use.
To change device ID on a rooted, Xposed Framework phone, use [this app](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.phoneinfo.changer)

### In Game Troubleshooting:

Make sure you can log out and back into standard PokemonGo App without any issues.

Make sure there is room for Pokemon and items.  After so much looting, everything gets full and you will need to clear it out.  Regarding Pokemon, use the app's 'Pokemon setting' to remove specific Pokemon and avoid manual effort.

You can always disable 'Location' on your phone, and log into the PoGO app to clear out your inventory and do manual micromanagement. Disabling 'Location' will make the red bar 'GPS not found' show up but you can still use the app. 
Always check this before asking here - usually your bag or pokeslots are full, or you have no balls. (Pun intended)
